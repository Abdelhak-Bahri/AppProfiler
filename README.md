The goal of this part is to provide Performance Monitoring Service for other applications. The following metrics can be meaured : CPU, Memory, Network and Power

AppProfiler is two parts : Application and library. The application basically implements an Adorid service  and makes it available to other apps.

An Example application will be added later

Library implements all required  functions for measuring performance.
